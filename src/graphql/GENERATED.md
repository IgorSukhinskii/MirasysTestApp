# Generated Code

This folder contains **auto-generated GraphQL types and operations**.

**Do not edit these files manually.**  

They are generated from your GraphQL schema using your code generation tool (e.g., `graphql-codegen`).  
To update them, run the appropriate generation command:

```bash
npx graphql-codegen --config codegen.ts
```

While you are working on GraphQL queries, you probably want to run it in watch mode:

```bash
npx graphql-codegen --config codegen.ts --watch
```
